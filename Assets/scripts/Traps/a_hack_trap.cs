	//		Update aug 2021 seems to set a goal for the npc linked to by the trap using the owner value of the trap.
	//				LBs trap has owner=12 which is stand still. Does this goal have another meaning?
    //      In Britannia where is is triggered by quest variables 109 and 112
    //      which are have you talked to british and have you been arrested
    //      possibly this trap is related to these events. 
    //      The britannia traps link to LBs index and the avatars index "1" (maybe used to manipulate the player/npc in certain scenarios)
    //      In the kilorn and the prison tower the move triggers that call it are disabled. They are linked to one of the humans
